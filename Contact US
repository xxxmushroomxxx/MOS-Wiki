<h1>Travel Information</h1>
<p>
CEMAST is on one of the most picturesque cycle routes in South Hampshire.  With a dedicated cycle lane off the main road, this is both a safe and healthy way to travel into College.  The new Centre has dedicated cycle bays with the latest secure hoop design and a covered shelter with CCTV monitoring to ensure bikes are kept secure. Students will be offered free safety cycle wear if they sign up as a regular cycle user.
The CEMAST campus will have a new bus stop right outside offering good transport links to Gosport and Fareham. The College is sponsoring two new dedicated bus services that will run twice in the morning and twice in the late afternoon.   CEMAST Route 1 will run from Fareham bus station & train station calling at stops along the Eclipse BRT before arriving at CEMAST.  Route 2 will offer a new service from the Gosport Ferry to the CEMAST site.  During the day a shuttle service will operate between CEMAST and the BRT interchange at Fort Brockhurst.  Journey times for both routes will be less than 25 minutes.  With high speed train connections from Fareham and a dedicated bus service from the station, CEMAST will be just a short journey away from the wider Portsmouth and Southampton area.
Subsidised termly and annual bus passes are available to purchase from the College â€“ please call 01329 815200 for further information.   Students who purchase a pass for CEMAST route 1 or 2 will benefit from free bus travel throughout the entire First Bus network.
Students who live in a household with a low income can apply for extra help with the cost of their bus pass. Contact a Student Finance Co-Ordinator on 01329 815292 to discuss further.

CEMAST provides 140 on-site parking bays for staff and students with provision for cars, scooters and motorbikes. Students will need to apply for a parking permit and priority will be given to disabled drivers and car sharers who will be offered a free parking space at CEMAST.
