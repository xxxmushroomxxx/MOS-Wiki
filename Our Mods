<h2> facilities </h2>
<h1> STARBUCKS </h1>
<p> Our starbucks offers almost all the drinks of a highstreet store but at a fraction of the price as we have subsidised it to make them significantly cheaper just for you. </p>
<h1> CAFE AREA </h1>
<p> The cafe area offers a fantastic selection of delicious meals at very affordable pricing. The area itself is very spacious, modern and relaxing so whether you want to sit in piece and finish some work or eat lunch with your friends, it is the perfect place to do so. </p>
<h1> ILRC </h1>
<p> Our ILRC (Interactive Learning Resource Centre) is effectively a super high-tech library, with state of the art desktop computers and laptops that you can hire to work anywhere around the campus it massively compliments the idea of a fresh and modern take on learning. Despite this, the area is not only for laptops we have a selection of useful textbook in paper so however you like <br> to learn we can accommodate it. </p>
<h1> IRLC FOR LEISURE </h1>
<p> In addition to our educational ILRC we have a separate computer area along the corridor that students can use whenever they please. On these computers they can do whatever they would like because we feel that education isn’t only about the skills you learn but the entire experience of being at a college. </p>
<h1> GYM AND LIBRARY AVAILABLE AT FAREHAM COLLEGE </h1>
<p> If you think we are strictly high-tech, think again. Just down the road at the main Fareham College campus you can find a fully equipped gym for you to use in your free time and a conventional library for if you would like to escape to another world. Not only is this possibility available but we encourage you to take the short journey and even lay on buses. </p>
<h1> RECREATION AREA (OUTSIDE) </h1>
<p> A misconception about college is that all of a students time is spent inside however we not only have ground-breaking facilities inside but also fantastic ones outside. Our multi purpose play are is perfect for playing football or just breathing in the fresh air. </p>
<h1> SOLENT ENTERPRISE AREA </h1>
<p> Not so much a facility but a tremendous advantage to students, we are built on the Solent Enterprise Area which means the government has set aside the area for high tech business. You can see real life proof of this behind the college where a new building of the same style is being constructed at an astounding pace with the intention of it accommodating some of the businesses we benefit with our fantastic courses. This adds further to the near perfection of our partnership programme as students can speak <br> to the companies they could be working for and then return to the classroom to put newfound knowledge into action. </p>
<h1> STAFF ROOM </h1>
<p> In most schools or places of education the staff room is strictly off limits but, our area is easily accessible by students as we feel it is vital for teachers and students to have the means to communicate effortlessly. It is the best place to find a teacher whether it is to talk about something you’re struggling with, homework, catching up or any other matter. </p>
<h1> BUS ROUTES </h1>
<p>  We know that not all of our students can drive or be driven to college and so we have fantastic bus routes to cover the largest area possible so getting to CEMAST is as easy as possible. </p>
<br>
<h3> ~ IN EACH WORKSHOP ~ </h3>
<br>
<h1> REAL LIFE EQUIPMENT </h1>
<p> In each workshop we have obtained the equipment that you would be working on if you were employed in the field to name one, in the aerospace engineering workshop we have an RAF helicopter, a real life passenger jet engine and a fighter jet. What other college in the area would have these amazing, real life facilities in every classroom? </p>
<h1> WORKSPACE </h1>
<p>  Despite most of the workshops being based around the practical element of all the courses it is still very important that the practical element is adressed which is why we have an area in each workshop set aside for theory. In that area though, the technology is still a key aspect. We have interactive whiteboards in each workshop that allow our teachers to easily communicate aspects of the course through a variety of medias whether it be drawings, bullet points, videos, example questions <br> or almost anything else for that matter. </p>
