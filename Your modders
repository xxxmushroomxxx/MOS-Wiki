					<h2> Your College </h2>
						<p>
						Whatever your career aims and goals, CEMAST can help you achieve them! Our selections of Automotive, Engineering, and Manufacturing courses have been developed  with industry leaders to ensure that our students complete their courses with relevant experience and industry standard knowledge. Previous students have continued to higher education, advanced apprenticeships, employment and self employment. Together we can ensure you continue in whatever direction suits you. </p>

					<h1>Enrichment</h1>
					<p>
					Enrichment is the opportunity to participate in extra-curricular activities. This is a great way to meet new people, and gives you the chance to do something you may not have done before. It also looks great on your CV, as it shows you have other interests besides your core studies. Enrichment activities include:
						<p>Health and Fitness</p>
						<p>Student Board</p>
						<p>Duke of Edinburgh Award</p>
						<p>Trips and visits</p>
						<p>Volunteering</p>
						<p>Gliding</p>
					
					<p>Students may also suggest other activities that are relevant to their studies, so there will be many more to choose from in September.<p>
